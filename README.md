## Hey there!

### I'm Amanda, and I am currently a Master's student at ASU completing the GIT program.

After graduation, I hope to use my Master's to pivot careers into the graphic design field. This is my first foray into coding, and I'm excited to practice and learn more! 

Outside of school, I ride horses, read, hang with my pets, and train for half marathons!
